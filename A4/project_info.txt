Team: not working on a team

Project: Reversi with Monte-Carlo Tree Search
 
Language: Java JDK 14

Libraries: since the Java standard library is quite extensive, I don't 
           expect I'll need to import any other libraries for my project.
           If I do, they will adhere to the guidelines of the assignment 
           and be bundled with the project submission.
